Code of Conduct v1.0

Radio Therapy Machine Learning (RTML) Network, August 2018

The RTML Network is a community intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the participation of every community member, and want all who attend our meetings to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees at RTML events are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout, and to abide by the following Code of Conduct. Any issues can be brought to the confidential attention of the organisers of any RTML event (including via e-mail to contact@radiotherapymlnetwork.co.uk). Thank you for helping make this a welcoming and friendly community for all.

Code of Conduct

The RTML community is comprised of individuals from around the globe, and each brings with them a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our community to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both inside and outside of our community. Our goal is to the RTML Network a positive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.

As members of the community,

* We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment- and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary jokes, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention are not appropriate.

* We pledge to respect the work of others by recognising acknowledgement/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or acknowledged.

* We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and realise that including people with a variety of opinions and backgrounds will only serve to enrich the network. In particular, discussions relating to pros/cons of various methodologies, scientific approaches, technologies, programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be done with respect, taking proactive measures to ensure all participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely express their opinions.

* We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying particular attention to those new to the community.

* We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive to encourage behaviours that stimulate productive debate and disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticised. We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as people within our community.

* We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct, and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate this code such as notifying an event organiser, emailing contact@radiotherapymlnetwork.co.uk, or talking privately with those running/hosting the event. Those hosting the event are duty bound, upon being notified of an issue, to discuss the issue raised within the organising committee.

This code of conduct applies to all community situations on-line and off-line, including meetings/events, mailing lists, forums, social media, social events associates with the meetings/events, and one-to-one interactions.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the event at the sole discretion of the conference organisers.

Photography is allowed, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).

Sponsors and partners are also subject to the same code of conduct described above.
